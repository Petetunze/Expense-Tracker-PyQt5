# Expense-Tracker-PyQt5

### A semester project for CYBI3331.01/90R: Software Engineering and Project Management

This repo only consists of the source code for the Expense Tracker project.

If you would like to download and run locally, this project requires `PyQt5` and `openpyx`.

`PyQt5` - https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/

`openpyxl` - https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/


If you don't want to do that, I have a link to the ZIP file that consists of the virtual environment with the required modules. All you need is a Python interpreter to run this with. I have linked the OneDrive link to ZIP file (You need a UTRGV account to access this). It was too large to upload here.
